I have tried adding typeScript in Jokes file.

I haven't work with typescript but by reviewing current code and working with it for 3-4 days I will definitely be able to work with it.

### `npm run dev`

Concurrently launches App and Server on respective Port.

**Note: Run 'npm run dev' script and use MobileFirst as user name and Test1234 as password or you can SignUp with different User name and use that. json-server-auth API response only contains access-token, To display username email is used.**

User name :- MobileFirst
password :- Test1234

### `Optionally `

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`

Launches the json-server [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:3000) for imitate API calls.
